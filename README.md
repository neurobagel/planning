# Neurobagel planning repo

This repository is for planning
purposes and contains only workflows
that support planning.

This repository is also where we keep the
default list of labels that we want to 
have in every repository under the neurobagel
organization. 
Labels are automatically synced with other 
repositories whenever a label is changed.

To see our current work, take a look at:
